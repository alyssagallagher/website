                        Hey! I'm Jason, a Software Engineer focusing on Android development. I'm originally from Southern New Jersey and currently work in the Philadelphia Area. I studied Computer and Electrical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University and graduated in 2015. I am a lover of all things technical and am love learning how things work and applying that knowledge to future projects. When I am not coding you can find me shredding at the local skatepark.

                <h3>Grassroots Unwired</h3>
                <h4>Android Developer</h4>
                <p>
                    I currently work as the lead mobile developer at Grassroots Unwired. My work focuses
                    on the Grassroots Unwired mobile android app. The purpose of the app is to enhance face to face fundraising and political canvassing through door to door interaction. The app provides several features that allow canvassers to ask questions and report information
                    about potential donors without the need for paper and pencil with data entry. I've focused on several features and architectural improvements of our application. For one, our application is not on the google play store. For this reason, clients cannot receive updates seamlessly through the play store. Before I arrived at grassroots, clients would need to update the app versions manually as new features, bugs were fixed etc. This took up valuable customer support time and developer time, when the problem was often fixed by simply updating the app. I saw a big oppurtunity to cut time and effort here, so I proposed and implemented a self updating feature. This made the lives of customers, and our own works much better, a big win for everyone. My next big project was to streamline payment processors. Our app often involves buying products and making donations. Over time, we began to support several different payment providers. Many of the implementation details were left on the mobile app side, I was an oppurtunity to keep everyting consistent by proposing a generic api to deal with payments server side, leaving the details and updates for the backend. Another big undertaking I took was ensuring overall health for the codebase. I immediately switch us over from eclipse to android studio and maintained different branches that allowed code to be shared across all of our applications. Next, I started incorporating some best practices into the application by separating out code into architectural patterns (MVVM). I started working with Dagger 2 to help dependencies which was great for testability.

                <p>
                    I lead the development of several applications while at Vanik Interactive. I was the sole android developer for the Philalphia Zoo's new mobile application that allows users to get information, navigate around the park, and find animals in real time, and provide there own pictures. I also played a role in a few smaller apps, including a chat app for children "MyMessenger". An informational app for the Democratic National Convention "DNC Donkeys", and provided the social media apis for the Slyce app's social feed from twitter, instagram, and facebook. I also dabbled in iOS where I was in charge of completing the Zoo360 application and releasing it to the play store. I also coded the DNC Donkeys app for iOS.

                    Worked on many hardware and software projects focused on brining water quality measurement information to those who cannot afford expensive devices. I helped build and design a handheld turbidimeter. Worked on another android application that read turbidity using the camera and image processing, with an additional 3d printed attatchement that that housed a cuvette.
