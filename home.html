                <h3>Grassroots Unwired</h3>
                <h4>Android Developer</h4>
                <p>
                    I am currently the Lead Android Developer at Grassroots Unwired. I primarily work on our Android app which works to enhance face-to-face fundraising and political canvassing for door to door interactions. It eliminates the need for typical pencil and paper data acquisition, and subsequent manual data entry. Some of my key contributions to the app include the addition of a self updating app to ensure clients have the latest release (our application is NOT on the play store). I've also designed and implemented a generic api for payments to simplify collection from the many different payment providers used by our clients. Finally, I've worked extremely hard to improve the overall application architecture and codebase health to provide a more friendly environment conducive to testability. 
                    <!--
                    The app provides several features that allow canvassers to ask questions and report information
                    about potential donors without the need for paper and pencil with data entry. I've focused on several features and architectural improvements of our application. For one, our application is not on the google play store. For this reason, clients cannot receive updates seamlessly through the play store. Before I arrived at grassroots, clients would need to update the app versions manually as new features, bugs were fixed etc. This took up valuable customer support time and developer time, when the problem was often fixed by simply updating the app. I saw a big oppurtunity to cut time and effort here, so I proposed and implemented a self updating feature. This made the lives of customers, and our own works much better, a big win for everyone. My next big project was to streamline payment processors. Our app often involves buying products and making donations. Over time, we began to support several different payment providers. Many of the implementation details were left on the mobile app side, I was an oppurtunity to keep everyting consistent by proposing a generic api to deal with payments server side, leaving the details and updates for the backend. Another big undertaking I took was ensuring overall health for the codebase. I immediately switch us over from eclipse to android studio and maintained different branches that allowed code to be shared across all of our applications. Next, I started incorporating some best practices into the application by separating out code into architectural patterns (MVVM). I started working with Dagger 2 to help dependencies which was great for testability. -->

                <h3>Vanik Interactive</h3>
                <h4>Android Developer</h4>
                <p>
                    Worked on several different projects and applications, primarily focusing on Android. My favorite accomplishment was developing the Android version of Philadelphia Zoo's interactive app, Zoo360Insider, which I developed from start through to the Google Play Store release. I also fully implemented DNC Donkeys, an informational app for the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, on both iOS and Android. Another Android App I developed was a port of an existing messaging app for children called MyMessenger. 
                    Other than app development, I played a vital part in a few other projects focusing on backend work and even dabbled with some hardware. I wrote a simple web scraper used to populate and update the backend database for the NJ Hall of Fame App. I learned to consume the twitter, facebook, and instagram APIs to expose a webservice used for displaying the latest relevant posts for SMDay PHL, an information app for Social Media Day Philadelphia 2016. Finally, I broke out my ECE skills from college when I used a few arduinos to control and synchronize a few light bulbs for a tradeshow exhibit. 
                    <!--
                    Some of my favorite features include real time path mapping and navigation to any desired exhibit or point of interest. Another fun feature was a crowd-sourced heat map showing latest animal sightings in the <a href="http://www.philadelphiazoo.org/Explore/Zoo360-Animal-Trails.htm">Zoo 360 Trails.</a> Besides the Android app, another developer and I implemented the application backend and database which was shared with the iOS app. Finally, I got the chance to get my hands dirty with iOS when I undertook the task of completing the last month of development and ultimately releasing it on the iOS App Store.
                    While at Vanik Interactive, I also implemented an app providing helpful information about the Democratic National Convention, "DNC Donkeys, for both iOS and Android. 
                    I lead the development of several applications while at Vanik Interactive. I was the sole android developer for the Philalphia Zoo's new mobile application, "Zoo360Insder" that helps users find information, navigation to destinations, locate animals in real time, and share there experience with other guests by posting their photos. Other apps I implemented at Vanik include "MyMessenger", a chat application for children, "DNC Donkeys" an informational app for the Democratic National Convention "DNC Donkeys" which I developed for both iOS and Android, and released to the associated stores. Additionally, I used public apis to implement real time social feeds from twitter, instagram, and facebook for "SMDAYPHL", an informational app for Philadelphia's social media day, released on both iOS and Android. Finally, I did some webscraping to keep up to date information for the "NJ Hall of Fame" application

                <p>
                    Worked on hardware and software used to obtain high resolution water quality data at a price affordable universally. I helped build and design a handheld turbidimeter, using a microcontroller attached to various peripherals including a light sensor to measure and display turbidity, which roughly equates to the amount of particles in a sample of water. I primarily focused on user input and output via an interface controlled using a joystick and displayed on a TFT LCD screen. Features included selecting and starting a measurement type, updating settings, and ultimately displaying measured data. I also programmed an Android application which used the camera to take several sequential images of a cuvette mounted to the device. Image processed thereafter resulted in a numerical measurement value representing the cleanliness of water in a cuvette.

My work at Grassroots is an ongoing process where I balance the responsibilities of adding and designing new features, creating a streamlined release process, and improving the existing application architecture.

Next, it pulls dynamic surveys from a backend server that are used to display and collect data during face to face interactions. The application also works in a completely offline state allowing canvassers to continue working without an internet connection, later syncing all local changes when a connection is established.

                            Worked on hardware and software used to obtain high resolution water quality data at a price affordable universally. I helped build and design a handheld turbidimeter, using a microcontroller attached to various peripherals including a light sensor to measure and display turbidity, which roughly equates to the amount of particles in a sample of water. I primarily focused on user input and output via an interface controlled using a joystick and displayed on a TFT LCD screen. Features included selecting and starting a measurement type, updating settings, and ultimately displaing measured data. I also programmed an Android application which used the camera to take several sequential images of a cuvette mounted to the device. Image processed thereafter resulted in a numerical measurement value represting the cleanliness of water in a cuvette.
