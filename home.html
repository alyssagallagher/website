I studied Computer and Electrical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University and graduated in 2015. I am humbled and awed by today's technical achievements and love learning how things work and using new knowledge in applications with my projects.

                <h3>Grassroots Unwired</h3>
                <h4>Android Developer</h4>
                <p>
                    I currently work as the lead mobile developer at Grassroots Unwired. My work focuses
                    on the Grassroots Unwired mobile android app. The app's purpose is to enhance face to face fundraising and political canvassing through door to door interaction. It eliminates the need for typical pencial and paper data aquisition, and manual data entry. Some of my key contributions to the app include providing an automatic updater as our application is not on the play store, implementing a generic api for payements, and improving app architecture and tetability by incoporating design patterns and dependency injection. 

                    <!--
                    The app provides several features that allow canvassers to ask questions and report information
                    about potential donors without the need for paper and pencil with data entry. I've focused on several features and architectural improvements of our application. For one, our application is not on the google play store. For this reason, clients cannot receive updates seamlessly through the play store. Before I arrived at grassroots, clients would need to update the app versions manually as new features, bugs were fixed etc. This took up valuable customer support time and developer time, when the problem was often fixed by simply updating the app. I saw a big oppurtunity to cut time and effort here, so I proposed and implemented a self updating feature. This made the lives of customers, and our own works much better, a big win for everyone. My next big project was to streamline payment processors. Our app often involves buying products and making donations. Over time, we began to support several different payment providers. Many of the implementation details were left on the mobile app side, I was an oppurtunity to keep everyting consistent by proposing a generic api to deal with payments server side, leaving the details and updates for the backend. Another big undertaking I took was ensuring overall health for the codebase. I immediately switch us over from eclipse to android studio and maintained different branches that allowed code to be shared across all of our applications. Next, I started incorporating some best practices into the application by separating out code into architectural patterns (MVVM). I started working with Dagger 2 to help dependencies which was great for testability. -->

                <p>
                    I lead the development of several applications while at Vanik Interactive. I was the sole android developer for the Philalphia Zoo's new mobile application, "Zoo360Insder" that helps users find information, navigation to destinations, locate animals in real time, and share there experience with other guests by posting their photos. Other apps I implemented at Vanik include "MyMessenger", a chat application for children, "DNC Donkeys" an informational app for the Democratic National Convention "DNC Donkeys" which I developed for both iOS and Android, and released to the associated stores. Additionally, I used public apis to implement real time social feeds from twitter, instagram, and facebook for "SMDAYPHL", an informational app for Philadelphia's social media day, released on both iOS and Android. Finally, I did some webscraping to keep up to date information for the "NJ Hall of Fame" application
